Keep track of tasks that you need to do in this file.

HIGH
- tpl isn't working in minified script, no console error and no control panel displayed
- phetcommon/contrib/stats-r11.js doesn't work in minified script, should be using stats fork
- apply Bootstrap to DOM controls
- make it work with file:// (fails on Chrome)

MEDIUM
- consider putting build-related files in a build/ directory, perhaps leave grunt.js at top level

LOW
- placeholder for button that provides access to About, etc.
- investigate why the first occurrence of "<% token %>" in an HTML template (eg, control-panel.html) causes "not well-formed" error to console
