Keep track of tasks that you need to do in this file.

HIGH
- fork stats.js and make changes to work with requirejs
- apply Bootstrap to DOM controls
- make it work with file:// (fails on Chrome)

MEDIUM
- adding almond in grunt concat task will mess up source maps, figure out a better way
- consider putting build-related files in a build/ directory, perhaps leave grunt.js at top level

LOW
- placeholder for button that provides access to About, etc.
- investigate why the first occurrence of "<% token %>" in an HTML template (eg, control-panel.html) causes "not well-formed" error to console
