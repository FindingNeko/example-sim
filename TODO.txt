Keep track of tasks that you need to do in this file.

HIGH
- apply Bootstrap to DOM controls
- make it work with file:// (fails on Chrome)
- grunt.js + package.json (documented)
- figure out how to use stats.js and fastclick.js with requirejs

MEDIUM
- format using idiomatic.js style
- consider putting build-related files in a build/ directory, perhaps leave grunt.js at top level
- rewrite PerformanceMonitor using inheritance (it's currently an adapter)

LOW
- placeholder for button that provides access to About, etc.
- delete example-sim-debug.html
- investigate why the first occurrence of <% token %> in an HTML template (eg, control-panel.html) causes "not well-formed" error to console
